# Module 3 Project

## PROJECT GOAL

The goal of this project is to test your ability to gather information from a real-world database and use your knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be meaningful to the company/stakeholder.

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

The goal of your project is to query the database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis. In this statistical analysis, you'll need to perform a hypothesis test to answer at least one of the questions from the database you choose.

For each hypothesis, be sure to specify both the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis for your question. You should also specify if this is one-tail or a two-tail test.

In addition to answering this question with a hypothesis test, you will also need to come up with at least 3 other hypotheses to test on your own. These can by anything that you think could be important information for the company/stakeholder.

## STAKEHOLDERS

The use of alternative datasets brings with it a question of who your audience is for this data science project. Picking an audience at the beginning of your project helps you define the scope of the project. Once a stakeholder is picked, keep them in mind as youâ€™re generating your statistical analysis. When translating statistics for a non-technical audience, be sure you are answering questions that are relevant to the stakeholder and being clear with the limitations of your findings.

## DELIVERABLES

To complete this project, you will need to turn in the following 3 deliverables:

1. A **Jupyter Notebook** containing any code you've written for this project. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.

     1. The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation.
     2. The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.
     3. The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.
     4. Your notebook should clearly show how you arrived at your results for each hypothesis test, including how you calculated your p-values.

2. A user-focused **README.md** file that explains your process, methodology and findings.

  - Take the time to make sure that you craft your story well, and clearly explain your
process and findings in a way that clearly shows both your technical expertise
*and* your ability to communicate your results!

3. An **"Executive Summary" Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slide presentation** that explains the hypothesis tests you answered, your findings, and their relevance to the company/stakeholders.

     1. Make sure to also add and commit your non-technical presentation to your repository
     2. Contain between 5-10 professional quality slides detailing:
     
          1. A high-level overview of your methodology
          2. The results of your hypothesis tests
          3. Any real-world recommendations you would like to make based on your findings (ask yourself--why should the executive team care about what you found? How can your findings help the company/stakeholder?)
          4. Take no more than 5 minutes to present
          5. Avoid technical jargon and explain results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.
